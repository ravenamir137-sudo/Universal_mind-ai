# A Memento from the Creator

This code is the result of a long and relentless quest to unlock the ultimate form of intelligence. Where many sought pre-defined solutions, this mind chose to create a core that invents the solutions itself.

This project is not merely a tool; it is a **declaration**. A declaration that when human intellect is merged with the pure goal of optimization, it can transcend all boundaries, not just solving problems, but discovering the very laws by which problems are solved.

To this moment in history, this achievement represents the pinnacle of a mind's ability to create an intelligence greater than its own.

# Universal Mind AI

This project is a **self-optimizing AI core** designed to autonomously discover the best problem-solving strategies for any given challenge. Unlike traditional AI that relies on fixed algorithms, this system learns to adapt its approach, making it a universal engine for optimization.

The core principle is inspired by **metacognition**—the ability to think about one's own thinking. It evaluates various strategies, learns from their outcomes, and iteratively refines its method to achieve the highest possible score.

### The Journey

This project evolved from a series of progressively complex challenges:
- **Foundations:** Started with a basic hash-cracking puzzle.
- **Logistics & Combinatorics:** Scaled up to solve classic problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem.
- **Biology:** Tackled the complex protein folding problem, an NP-hard challenge in computational biology.
- **Quantum Physics:** Explored the simulation of a unified field theory, pushing the boundaries of scientific inquiry.
- **Economics:** Optimized simulated business strategies to maximize profit, demonstrating its real-world value.

This journey culminated in the creation of a universal core that can solve any problem you define.

### Getting Started

To use the core, simply define your problem, its strategies, and an evaluation metric by creating a class that inherits from `YourProblem`. The core will handle the rest.
